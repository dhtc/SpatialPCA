Description: SpatialPCA is a spatially aware dimension reduction method that explicitly accounts for the spatial correlation across tissue locations. SpatialPCA can extract a low dimensional representation of the spatial transcriptomics data with enriched biological signal and preserved spatial correlation structure, thus unlocking many existing computational tools previously developed in single-cell RNAseq studies for tailored and novel analysis of spatial transcriptomics.
